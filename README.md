## 1. Sales Data Analysis 
Goal:
Use sales data analysis to find patterns, best-selling items, and revenue indicators to help make business decisions.
This project will require you to take into a sizable sales dataset in order to get some insightful information. To successfully convey your findings, you will compute revenue measures like
1. total sales,
2. analyze sales trends over time,
3. determine the best-selling products, and build visualizations.
This assignment demonstrates your capacity to work with and extract knowledge from huge datasets,
empowering you to provide data-driven suggestions for improving sales tactics.

## 2. HR Data Analytics 
Activities to complete:
Data cleansing involves removing unnecessary columns.
Giving the columns new names.
Eliminating redundant entries.
sanitizing specific columns.
Eliminate the dataset's NaN values.
Look for a few more changes if necessary

## 3. Titanic Survival Prediction
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered ‚Äúunsinkable‚Äù RMS Titanic sank
after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt enough lifeboats for everyone on board,
resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or
not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.
The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as
their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived
